## üß© Business Recommendations

### Marketing Campaigns for KP781

- The **KP781** model exhibits a significant sales disparity in terms of gender, with only 18% of total sales attributed to female customers.
- To enhance this metric, it is recommended to implement targeted strategies such as offering special promotions and trials exclusively designed for female customers.

### Affordable Pricing and Payment Plans

- Given the target customer's age, education level, and income, it's important to offer the KP281 and KP481 treadmills at an affordable price point.
- Consider providing flexible payment plans that allow customers to spread the cost over several months. This can make the treadmill more accessible to customers with varying budgets.

### User-Friendly App Integration

- Create a user-friendly app that syncs with the treadmill. This app could:
  - Track users' weekly running mileage.
  - Provide real-time feedback on their progress.
  - Offer personalized recommendations for workouts based on their fitness scale and goals.
- This can enhance the overall treadmill experience and keep users engaged.
